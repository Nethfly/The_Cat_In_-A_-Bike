            A little crazy, a little disastrous, but supposedly a very good person, well, that's what those who know me say. Gamer, cat lover, Star Wars fanatic, cyclist by passion, lover of adventures, enamored with plans that arise and come out of nowhere. Get to know me and you'll see a bit more of me.

          <p>
            My name is John, I am (put your age here).... I'm not going to tell you my age, that's so rude. I am from this beautiful city Bogotá which I love with my heart. Since I was a kiddo I love videogames, the sports, especifically the extreme sports, that is the reason why I practice Enduro on weekends, of course, when I have enough time to do it. Regarding videogames, gosh, if I'm not wrong, I <em><q>borrowed</q></em> 20 pesos from my dad just to go to the arcade machine next to my home to play Super Mario.

            People used to say I'm a kind soul, always thinking of others first. Not sure if that's true, but hey, I am a little crazy, an adventure nut, and definitely a disaster magnet. My cats would totally agree I'm their servant (sometimes I think so too!). Oh, and one more thing: don't forget to smile - it's your best weapon!
